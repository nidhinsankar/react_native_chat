## Chat Clone UI

As a new react native developer iam trying to build a chat app to learn basics of building Ui with react native

## Mistakes and learning

- tried basic react navigation in the app and was able to create screen and create a basic routing with it
- didn't properly understand the statusbar styling and learned about using safeareaprovider and using insets of it
- made mistake while using flatlist in the place of renderItem i used _user_ because i thought we can specify the variable in the renderItem prop but we should always need to use Item from the renderItem prop
- When working with images from online source we need to specify the wifth height by ourself
